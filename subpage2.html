      <h3><b>Conservation Efforts</b></h3>
      <h5>Conserving Apes and Their Habitats, <span class="w3-opacity">December 12, 2022</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Our shared evolutionary history and connections with apes reveals the need for humans to take action to ensure that they do not become extinct, or that their habitats will not be destroyed. 
        As a group, the great apes are endangered. There are several ways in which humans contribute to the apes’ threatened way of life, including but not limited to climate change, human population growth, 
        rising economic expectations, and the loss of habitat availability. Humans often seek to use apes’ rainforest habitats for crop raiding and agricultural purposes, which not only destroys ape habitats, but can also kill or injure them in the process. 
        Because humans are the most immediate force threatening to exterminate other apes entirely, we must do everything within our power to work towards conservation efforts for apes and their habitats.
        There are several conservation projects that exist to work towards the goals of conservation of different apes. </p>
      <h3> Orangutans </h3>
      <p> As the ape with the slowest life history, orangutans are particularly at risk when it comes to their conservation. Their habitats in Southeast Asia are being destroyed for palm oil production, often killing them in the process, or leaving them 
        without a home. However, several conservation organizations are trying to combat this. </p>
      <h5> <li><a href="https://www.sumatranorangutan.org/">Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme</a></li></h5>
      <p> This project is working towards ape conservation through rehabilitating and reintroducing some ex-captive orangutans to the wild, and by working against deforestation.
        The group is working with Indonesian authorities to address issues of illegal orangutan capture and trading. 
        As deforestation continues to happen, their website explains, orangutans often become isolated away from the rest of the forest and from food resources.  
        When this happens, SOCP helps relocate them to increase their chances of survival. </p>
