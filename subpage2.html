      <h3><b>Conservation Efforts</b></h3>
      <h5>Conserving Apes and Their Habitats, <span class="w3-opacity">December 12, 2022</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Our shared evolutionary history and connections with apes reveals the need for humans to take action to ensure that they do not become extinct, or that their habitats will not be destroyed. 
        As a group, the great apes are endangered. There are several ways in which humans contribute to the apes’ threatened way of life, including but not limited to climate change, human population growth, 
        rising economic expectations, and the loss of habitat availability. Humans often seek to use apes’ rainforest habitats for crop raiding and agricultural purposes, which not only destroys ape habitats, but can also kill or injure them in the process. 
        Because humans are the most immediate force threatening to exterminate other apes entirely, we must do everything within our power to work towards conservation efforts for apes and their habitats.
        There are several conservation projects that exist to work towards the goals of conservation of different apes. </p>
      <h3> Orangutans </h3>
      <p> As the ape with the slowest life history, orangutans are particularly at risk when it comes to habitat destruction and killing. Their habitats in Southeast Asia are being destroyed for palm oil production, often killing them in the process, or leaving them 
        without a home. However, several conservation organizations are trying to combat this. </p>
      <h5> <li><a href="https://www.sumatranorangutan.org/">Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme</a></li></h5>
      <p> This project is working towards ape conservation through rehabilitating and reintroducing some ex-captive orangutans to the wild, and by working against deforestation.
        The group is working with Indonesian authorities to address issues of illegal orangutan capture and trading. 
        As deforestation continues to happen, their website explains, orangutans often become isolated away from the rest of the forest and from food resources.  
        When this happens, SOCP helps relocate them to increase their chances of survival. </p>
      <h5> <li><a href="https://savegporangutans.org/">Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Program</a></li></h5>
      <p> This project takes the approach of long-term scientific research building support for orangutan conservation. Research helps conservation by monitoring the size, health, and habitat use of populations. 
        Their approach is also community-based, as they work with local communities, NGOs, and government offices to protect orangutans and their habitats. Orangutan researcher Dr. Cheryl Knott established this program, 
        and it is one of the longest running studies and conservation initiatives of wild orangutans. </p>
      <h3> Gorillas </h3>
      <p> Like orangutans, gorillas are also facing threats to their habitat and survival. People and businesses continue to clear land in gorillas' habitats for agricultural purposes or for the limited natural resources the forest hosts.
        Gorilla conservation has seen success in recent years, with mountain gorillas' numbers in particularly rising above 1,000. However, the fight for gorilla conservation is still an ongoing one,
        and it is crucial to stay informed of and support conservation projects working towards these efforts. </p>
      <h5> <li><a href="https://igcp.org/">International Gorilla Conservation Program</a></li></h5>
      <p> This project focuses on mountain gorilla conservation in particular, partnering with organizations and academic institutions to facilitate research and conservation science in the region in which gorillas live, 
        in order to better advocate for conservation using research and data acquired from monitoring gorilla populations. 
        The project also puts an emphasis on collaboration and communication, working with rangers and assisting patrols and training programs to improve the quality of protection of the apes and rainforest. </p> 
      <h3> Chimpanzees </h3>
      <p> Chimpanzees also face habitat loss and destruction in Africa due to logging, hunting, mining, and agricultural expansion leading to deforestation. 
        However, there are also conservation projects aimed at providing sanctuary for chimpanzees in need.</p>
      <h5> <li><a href="https://projectchimps.org/">Project Chimps</a></li></h5>
      <p>Founded in 2014, the stated mission of this project is to “provide lifelong exemplary care to chimpanzees retired from research.” 
        The project is a sanctuary in north Georgia for chimpanzees to live and be cared for after being used in laboratory research. 
        It encourages people to learn about chimpanzees, support their care, and fight against their mistreatment. </p>
       <h5> <li><a href="https://www.bonobo.org/">Bonobo Conservation Initiative</a></li></h5>
      <p> The Bonobo Conservation Initiative has worked with its partners to establish the Peace Forest, which works towards the goal of ensuring the safety of the bonobos and their habitat within a designated nine million acre area (though two more are in progress). 
        Two of the areas are officially protected- the Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve and Sankuru Nature Reserve- while others are still in development, but still provide a safe haven for bonobos, and the other animals and plants that live within their habitat. 
        The group also places emphasis on education, as the site provides information not only threats to bonobo survival, but also their vocal calls and general information about the ape. </p>
      <h3> What Can YOU Do To Help? </h3>
      <p> These are just a few ways you can support ape conservation:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Donate</strong> to support conservations projects such as the ones listed above.</li>
        <li><strong>Learn more</strong> about apes and the threats that they face, and teach others about what you learn.</li>
        <li>Participate in sustainable and responsible <strong>ecotourism</strong>, which brings in money to local areas and encourages conservation.</li>
        <li><strong>Be conscious</strong> of the products you buy. Many manufacturers sell products containing palm oil, and by refusing to buy these items, you can show that consumers care about habitat destruction.</li>
      </ul>
