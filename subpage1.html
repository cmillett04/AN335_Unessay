      <h3><b>Great Apes and Humans: Our Connection</b></h3>
      <h5><span class="w3-opacity">December 12, 2022</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Great Apes as a group belong in the genus <em>Hominidae</em>. Humans share this taxonomic family with three other genera: chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. 
        The species within these groups consist of the animals most genetically similar to humans, and hence, examining their behavior and social structures can provide exceptional insights into that of humans, 
        along with a deeper understanding of our own evolutionary history. It is with this in mind that we turn to the other apes for an overview of each of their behaviors and habitats. </p>
      <h5><strong>Orangutans</strong></h5>
      <p>Unlike the other non-human apes, which have black or darker brown fur, the orangutan is well-known for its reddish-orange fur color. Orangutans are the largest living arboreal mammal, and they are spread out across two different 
        islands in Southeast Asia: Borneo and Sumatra (in the nations of Indonesia and Malaysia). There are three species of orangutans: <em>Pongo pygmaeus, Pongo abelii,</em> and <em>Pongo tapanuliesis,</em> the last of which was only recognized as a distinct species in 2017. </p>
      <p>Much of orangutan behavior and social structure can be explained in terms of their unpredictable and low food availability. The rainforests in which they live go through periods of mast fruiting followed by long periods of low fruit availability, in which they rely more on fallback foods in their diet. 
        These high fluctuations in fruit availability mean that the apes are spread out and largely solitary, are very sexually dimorphic, have extremely long inter-birth intervals, have a slower life history, and high rates of sexual coercion. 
        A morphological feature unique to orangutans is male bi-maturism, in which adult males can take on one of two different forms: flanged or unflanged. 
        Flanged males have cheek pads, long, loud vocalizations, and are preferred by ovulating females, whereas unflanged males do not have cheek pads, have a higher percentage of forced copulations, and are generally avoided by ovulating females.
      <h5><strong>Gorillas</strong></h5 >
      <p>Gorillas are recognized by their large body size, knuckle-walking locomotion, and their silverback males. They live in different areas across equatorial Africa, and are further divided into Western gorillas (<em> Gorilla gorilla </em>) and Eastern gorillas (<em> Gorilla beringei </em>). 
        In comparison to other apes, gorillas have the fastest life history, living only 20-30 years in the wild, and having an inter-birth interval of around 4 years. 
        Their diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting of leaves, stems, pith, bamboo, tubers, and flowers, among other plants. This diet is facilitated by their hind-gut fermentation, adapted to digest gorillas’ tough, cellulose-packed diet. 
        Their social system is ordinarily composed of one male and multiple females, in which the male is a silverback who protects the females from other infanticidal males. </p>
      <p>Infanticide is common in gorillas, and the phenomenon influences the structure and organization of female gorillas. The purpose of infanticide is thought to be to reduce inter-birth intervals in
        females, so that they become reproductively available again for males to mate with. Infanticide can influence female organization, because when females are aware that infanticide is a threat 
        to the lives of their offspring, they are more likely to seek male protection from predators. In this way, infanticide serves the reproductive interests of males, because it allows silverback males to 
        monopolize mating access to a group of females in exchange for protection from other males. </p>
      <h5><strong> Chimpanzees </strong></h5>
      <p>Chimpanzees are the apes closest to us in terms of similar genetic makeup. They live in different regions across central Africa, in fission-fusion communities, in which a large party of apes is composed of smaller parties whose members frequently change. 
        Females disperse from their birth group to join other groups, and their mating system is promiscuous. They are ripe fruit specialists, and a high proportion of their diet consists only of fruit. </p>
      <p> The two different species under the genus Pan are significant to distinguish due to their stark behavioral differences. The first and more well-known species is Pan troglodytes.
        This species includes several subspecies who live in areas spread out across central and Western Africa. Chimps are known for their extensive tool use for activities such as termite fishing, and hunt other animals such as small monkeys.
        While both species are promiscuous, chimpanzees are male-dominated and have a stricter hierarchical system, and male harassment of females is much more common.
        They also do not have friendly inter-group relations and males will patrol the border of their territory. </p>
      <p> The other species under the genus Pan is Pan paniscus, or bonobos. Though bonobos are slightly different in terms of their morphology- they are more gracile and have darker faces and parted hair.
         Unlike chimps, bonobos are female dominant or codominant with males. They rarely use tools or hunt. When they do interact with monkeys, according to some researchers, they seem to view them more as play toys than as potential food.
         Bonobos are also more known for their more frequent sexual behavior, especially their non-conceptive sexuality. Bonobos use sex to form stronger bonds with one another and often mate with the same sex as well.
        Their more relaxed social structure and female dominance is enabled by the habitat in which they live. Living on the other side of the Congo River, they do not face the same competition with gorillas that chimpanzees do.
        With more abundant food availability, females are able to form stronger bonds with one another and dominate males, and are also sexually receptive more often. </p>
      <p>Interesting to consider in terms of the differences in chimpanzee and bonobo behavior is the amount of behaviors humans appear to share with both of them. 
        For example, like chimpanzees, humans also participate in coalitionary killings, males being aggressive towards females, group huntings, tool use, and strong male-male bonds.
        However, we are similar to bonobos because humans also participate in non-conceptive sex, have strong female-female bonds, and can have peaceful inter-group relationships and egalitarian males.
        By observing the similarities between ourselves and our closest living relatives, we can also recognize the importance of conserving them and their habitats, so that we may continue to learn about them. </p>
