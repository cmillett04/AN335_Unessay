Hey cmoney wutup is ya boi

So ya I'm gonna use the readme to tell u how to do shit for now so that u can do whatever

Oh by the way heres the [website link](https://cmillett04.github.io/AN335_Unessay/)

Ok ya so here we go

* Editing Text
	- So like this is pretty basic just look for white text. Honestly pretty much anything that's not enclosed by <> is just plain text that u can edit, or just reference the website while u edit the code.

* Changing Images       
	- This is ezpz too just find the pic on the site in the code (look for nearby text or other clues)
	- When u actually find it, it will look like "<img src="_____" ... >"
	- Download the pic u wanna replace it with (remember it will stretch to fit the dimensions)
	- Send to beef and give him the name of the thing after src=
	- He will replace for u and voila (u could do it too but that requires gross terminal)

* Sub-Pages / ~~__*Spicy*__~~ Text
	- Look in subpage1.html for the page that u go to for the first learn more, same for second
	- To make text bold, surround it with strong tags (<strong>BEEF<strong>)
	- To make text italics, surround it with em tags (<em>beef</em>)
	- Anything else, look up or ask the beef

I even think that's it for now! Lmk if u have questions <3
